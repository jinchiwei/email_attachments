call smtplib to email 3 of 20 possible files to recipients and keep records of sent items to avoid overlap

### if using gmail:
set up an app password (a general password used specifically for less secure apps) here:\
https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/apppasswords

this will require 2 factor authentication (google settings -> security -> 2-factor authentication).

in the "address_password.txt" file, enter your:\
email address after "address: "\
app password after "password: "
